-> Engineered a Java-based Student Database Management System using JDBC and MySQL that handles CRUD operations (add, view, update, delete) on hundreds of student records.

-> Packaged the entire application and MySQL database in Docker containers, slashing deployment/setup across different machines/environments.

-> Designed a Data Access Layer (StudentDAO + DataBaseConnection classes) to reliably connect, fetch, and manipulate student data.

-> Integrated MySQL Java Connector (mysql-connector-j-9.x) to ensure stable connectivity between Java app and database.
