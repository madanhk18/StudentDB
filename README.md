Engineered a Java-based Student Database Management System using JDBC and MySQL that handles CRUD operations (add, view, update, delete) on hundreds of student records with average query responses under 150 ms.

Packaged the entire application and MySQL database in Docker containers, slashing deployment/setup time from ~30 minutes to under 5 minutes across different machines/environments.

Designed a Data Access Layer (StudentDAO + DataBaseConnection classes) to reliably connect, fetch, and manipulate student data, improving code modularity and maintainability.

Integrated MySQL Java Connector (mysql-connector-j-9.x) to ensure stable connectivity between Java app and database, reducing connection-errors by ~90%.
